Above are 6 different projects that I completed in my first semester of college. 

## Project 1
This project simulates a store. It takes in user input for an item, price of item, number of item, then basic shipping infromation to create a bill of information about the purchase. 
## Project 2
A calculator app for something like a hospital to find out their burn rate given user input. Assuming a box of something is 200 the user would enter something like gloves then enter their inventory numbers for the given week and will give them 3 calculations average number of boxes used, total left, and number of days left remaining.
## Project 3
Gathers job titles from user input and random salaries to determine the min max or average salaries depending on which one the user selects.
## Project 5

## Project 6
